                  <p>Hello After Effects!</p>
                  <p>After Effects has a dark background color in the UI, so it&#x27;s hard to see the colors when I open the color palette and choose a fill color. I&#x27;ll have to decide all the colors I want to use with XD or Figma in advance.</p>
                  <p>Also, I learned the “u” shortcut key to show only properties with keyframes, “u” for use! Until I discovered this, I could only open or close all the properties of every layer, so I was having trouble seeing all the unimportant properties together when I just wanted to see one keyframe.</p>

                  <p>Today I found the speed graph for the keyframes that I couldn&#x27;t find yesterday! But I can&#x27;t specify the easing numerically like I do with CSS or GSAP, so I have to adjust everything by dragging operations, which makes it difficult to work out the details. I hope there is another good way hidden somewhere that I just don&#x27;t know about yet.</p>
                  <p>And our engineer&#x27;s buddy, transform-origin settings seem to be reproduced by specifying anchor points and positions. I didn&#x27;t understand how this works at first either, and the solid layers kept dancing in weird positions lol...</p>

                  <p>Wow~~~!!! I was so impressed that I can just select layers and press “s” to open the scale and “r” to open the rotation property. I wonder why I had to work so hard yesterday and the day before yesterday, opening and closing tabs every time I tried to display the properties I wanted...?</p>
                  <p>I also tried to the “Parent &amp; Link” layers to a null object by selecting them, but After Effects doesn&#x27;t allow me to drag children into a parent. The correct way is to use the “Pick Whip” to link them to the parent. Ok, I learned it.</p>

                  <p>Today, for the first time, I moved two properties together, so the speed graph also has two colors! The first color was red and the second was aqua, what will be the third color?</p>
                  <p>The best thing about After Effects is that we can always see as many previews as we want without having to render it. When we make animations in GSAP, we don&#x27;t know what the animation will look like until we save the file and play it in the web browser, and can&#x27;t pause it where we want. So, we have to reload the browser many times, set timescale to 0.1 instead of frame by frame, and stare at the screen to make sure there are no unnatural moments, but we don&#x27;t have to do that here!</p>

                  <p>Hmmm, I only animated the position property today, but the speed graph is white instead of red? I thought yesterday that the color is determined by the number of graph items, but I wonder what&#x27;s going on.</p>
                  <p>And for the first time I tried to use an effect! The name of the effect is called the “Turbulent Displacement” in the distortion category, a word I&#x27;ve never even heard of... At any rate, this looks like an effect that makes the layers squishy and distorted. I also tried to play with the evolution property, but I couldn&#x27;t get a good feel for it. OK, that&#x27;s enough for today.</p>

                  <p>Following yesterday, I tried the new effect “Radial Wipe” in the transition category.  I tried to make the color look like a lollipop candy... does it look like that?</p>
                  <p>What I think is kind of a trouble with After Effects is that when I want to change a part of the timeline a little, I have to shift all the layers that have keyframes after it by the same amount. I hope there&#x27;s some kind of convenient shortcut key for this. I haven&#x27;t studied it at all, so I don&#x27;t know.</p>

                  <p>Wahhhhh... It&#x27;s similar to the one I worked on yesterday, but today I tried using the “Trim Paths” on ellipses with only thick stroke without fill to move the start and end of ellipses. Yet, why doesn&#x27;t the animation feel good?</p>
                  <p>Maybe it&#x27;s just one of those days. I hope tomorrow will be better.</p>
                  <p>Anyway, today is the 7th day since I started this diary! I have never kept a diary for a week in my life haha.</p>

                  <p>Today is the Lunar New Year, so I also celebrated by shooting off a tiny firework~.</p>
                  <p>I tried to make many sparks by using the “Alpha Matte” and “Pre compose”, but no matter how much I worked on and even reworked them in the process, they didn&#x27;t end up becoming a suitable firework for the New Year&#x27;s celebration at all. Why is it so complicated...? I wonder if real pyrotechnicians also struggle like this for years and years to make wonderful fireworks. Someday, I&#x27;ll try again.</p>

                  <p>Here is my spiral that reminds of something yummy sweets. Such interesting shapes can be drawn just by adding the “Pucker &amp; Bloat” and “Twist” modifiers to a circle!</p>
                  <p>To be honest, I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to chain easings together to make it look better when I hit lots of keyframes like in this case. I think After Effects&#x27; easy ease is mild and so comfortable, but looking at animations made by seniors, I wonder if most of them prefer quite intense easings. Too fast movements are not so easy to understand, so basically, I think it would be better to use slightly stronger easings than the default easy ease.</p>

                  <p>Now I tried to draw a calm wave. Perhaps a little too calm?</p>
                  <p>The effect I used was “Wave Warp” from the distortion category. This is exactly the right effect to do this!</p>
                  <p>On its own, the boundaries of the waves were a bit jaggy. Applying the “Fast Box Blur” effect in the “Blur &amp; Sharp” category to blur them, then further adjusting the “Alpha” channel with the “Curves” effect in the “Color Correction” category, clean them up nicely. However, Unless you&#x27;re viewing this on a very large screen with super high resolution, it doesn&#x27;t matter. So I didn&#x27;t do this work in the end this time.</p>

                  <p>Again I played with the “Trim Paths”, which I was struggling with the other day. It looks like a pretty Naruto!</p>
                  <p>There are 4 arcs, not one shape in one shape layer like usual, today I tried for the first time to put 4 ellipses in one shape layer. But because of this, the trimming of the paths is over the entire shape layer, so even if I realized during the animation that the animation was monotonous or not enough, it is impossible to freely control the start and end of each path... I wonder if I tried adding some rotation to the layer?</p>
                  <p>Anyway, I&#x27;ll try again tomorrow to separate the layers by the number of items.</p>

                  <p>It&#x27;s Valentine&#x27;s Day~~! All these days I have been deciding to make this heart tunnel today.</p>
                  <p>It was the first time I dragged the anchor points of the path to draw a shape other than just rectangles and ellipses. After “Convert to Bezier Path” for the eclipse path, and switching to the pen tool and adjusting the anchor points, I got this heart. It was difficult to control the anchor points by dragging... I had to redo it many times and finally got the hang of it.</p>
                  <p>And this is also the first time I created a complete infinite loop animation. Just set the beginning of the work area in the middle of the animation, not at frame 0, I see. That&#x27;s a smart approach!</p>

                  <p>The morphing is one of my most awaited joys in After Effects, even before I started this diary. I thought that the morphing would be much more magical, but I did some unexpectedly steady work to make this today?? Well, I enjoyed it because it was the first time I played with many polygons.</p>
                  <p>Maybe if I prepare more adequate paths to play with, I can enjoy the magic of morphing even more?</p>

                  <p>I made a sticker motion today! The effect “CC Page Turn” was in the distortion category. As the name suggests, it is a perfect effect for turning a sticker like this.</p>
                  <p>Though when I was playing it back in preview, it was pretty jumpy, so I guess they really do a lot of calculations to make the motion fun. If I were to try to write this in JavaScript, it would be very hard~.</p>
                  <p>I still don&#x27;t know how to align multiple items in After Effects, so I just put these 4 stickers together by feel... I&#x27;ll have to look up the right way later.</p>

                  <p>Now I challenged the gradient! Doesn&#x27;t it look like a piece of amber sugar? I quite like some beautiful gradients.</p>
                  <p>Hmmm, I can&#x27;t believe how many times I had to re-render the animation because the color wasn&#x27;t as I expected it to be... Does the After Effects preview screen still look a little strange with the colors? There was no end anymore, so I decided to go with this...</p>
                  <p>Blurring is a very hard work in Web browser, and it seems to be the same in After Effects. Today I applied so many “Gaussian Blur” effects that the preview was really heavy.</p>
                  <p>But what I learned more than anything else today is that even when using the “Wiggle” in expression, it is possible to loop it if the formula is well written so that the two wiggles are interpolated linearly.</p>

                  <p>The ribbon&#x27;s motion was controlled by setting keyframes for its position. Using the “Keyframe Interpolation”, the path becomes a curve by setting the “Bezier” for both temporal and spatial. I tried my best to arrange the curve to be smooth, but it is difficult to control the handles, and some parts of the path are not smooth enough...</p>
                  <p>And the trajectory appeared by adding the “Echo” effect in the time category! As a first glance at the drawn trajectory was enough to guess, this is quite heavy processing. Today the rendering took a very long time.</p>

                  <p>I was not satisfied with the gradation of the day before yesterday, and tried again. This time I have mastered it completely!</p>
                  <p>Today, instead of using the wiggle expression, I set the anchor point for all the colored balls that make up the gradient at the center of the screen and keyframed them normally so that they rotate around that point. Then I used the “Inner Glow” in the layer styles, and I tried setting the blend mode to “Linear Light” for a shimmering glow.</p>
                  <p>I&#x27;ve already gotten the hang of drawing hearts for the third time, and the tones also turned out cute, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results. How do you like it?</p>

                  <p>Then, regarding After Effects, I tried to import a file from Illustrator for the first time today. At first I just prepared an svg file, but svg files can&#x27;t be imported. And I thought it was unkind that the layers had to be separated in Illustrator first, just to import some ai file?</p>

                  <p>When I was little, I remember playing the LocoRoco game on the PSP, and this feels a bit like the slime-like character called LocoRoco, which brings back memories.</p>
                  <p>Just by combining the “Fast Box Blur” effect in the “Blur &amp; Sharpen” category and the “Matte Choker” in the “Matte”, the liquid animation could be created. It was much easier than I expected, yay! Now I&#x27;m wondering what style of animation I could make with this next...</p>

                  <p>I just tried to make a glowing torus. Does it look like right torus, not just a circle?</p>
                  <p>I used the “Glow” effect in the “Stylize” category to give it a luminous look, but this effect is too difficult to adjust... What combination of colors and effects would bring about the ideal look was completely unclear to me.</p>
                  <p>However, this torus is just a combination of shadows, highlights, and glows to make it look a little more realistic, and in reality, it is just a solid figure. So one of these days, I&#x27;d like to spin around some proper 3D torus as well.</p>

I thought about what other shapes would be interesting to chain together, but all I could come up with was a heart, and so today&#x27;s animation is this one.</p>
                  <p>I used the Pick &amp; Whip again after a while to make each heart inherit the rotation keyframe of the null object, which is its parent, one after another. It was easier and more fun than I thought it would be!</p>

                  <p>Again I created a liquid gradient animation. Today I&#x27;m trying to move it in a new way again. There are so many different ways to do it.</p>
                  <p>So this time, after creating the gradient with “4 Color Gradient”, combining the “Turbulent Displacement” effect in the distortion category and the “Motion Tile” in the stylize on the adjustment layer, I got this motion. This way is easy and nice because the effects do all the work without having to manage the color balls that compose the gradient individually and adjust them with wiggle and transform.</p>
                  <p>However, the preview was very heavy and the exported file size was the largest I have ever seen. I don&#x27;t think any of the effects I used today were so heavy on their own, why is that?</p>
