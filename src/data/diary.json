      "Also, I learned the “u” shortcut key to show only properties with keyframes, “u” for use! Until I discovered this, I could only open or close all the properties of every layer, so I was having trouble seeing all the unimportant properties together when I just wanted to see one keyframe."

But I can't specify the easing numerically like I do with CSS or GSAP, so I have to adjust everything by dragging operations, which makes it difficult to work out the details. I hope there is another good way hidden somewhere that I just don't know about yet.",

      "I also tried to the “Parent & Link” layers to a null object by selecting them, but After Effects doesn't allow me to drag children into a parent. The correct way is to use the “Pick Whip” to link them to the parent. Ok, I learned it."

      "The best thing about After Effects is that we can always see as many previews as we want without having to render it. When we make animations in GSAP, we don't know what the animation will look like until we save the file and play it in the web browser, and can't pause it where we want. So, we have to reload the browser many times, set timescale to 0.1 instead of frame by frame, and stare at the screen to make sure there are no unnatural moments, but we don't have to do that here!"

At any rate, this looks like an effect that makes the layers squishy and distorted. I also tried to play with the evolution property, but I couldn't get a good feel for it.

I hope there's some kind of convenient shortcut key for this. I haven't studied it at all, so I don't know."

I think After Effects' easy ease is mild and so comfortable, but looking at animations made by seniors, I wonder if most of them prefer quite intense easings. Too fast movements are not so easy to understand, so basically, I think it would be better to use slightly stronger easings than the default easy ease."

Applying the “Fast Box Blur” effect in the “Blur & Sharp” category to blur them, then further adjusting the “Alpha” channel with the “Curves” effect in the “Color Correction” category, clean them up nicely. However, Unless you're viewing this on a very large screen with super high resolution, it doesn't matter. So I didn't do this work in the end this time."

But because of this, the trimming of the paths is over the entire shape layer, so even if I realized during the animation that the animation was monotonous or not enough, it is impossible to freely control the start and end of each path... I wonder if I tried adding some rotation to the layer?",

I had to redo it many times and finally got the hang of it.",
