      "Also, I learned the “u” shortcut key to show only properties with keyframes, “u” for use! Until I discovered this, I could only open or close all the properties of a layer, so I was having trouble seeing all the unimportant properties together when I just wanted to see one keyframe."

      "Today I found the speed graph for the keyframe that I couldn't find yesterday! But I can't specify the easing numerically like I do with css or gsap, so I have to adjust everything by dragging operations, which makes it difficult to work out the details. I hope there is another good way hidden somewhere that I just don't know about yet.",
